    <title>The Oxen and the Wheel</title>
    <h1>The Oxen and the Wheels
    <h2></h1>From Aesop's Fables</h2>

    <p>
      A pair of Oxen were drawing a heavy loaded wagon along a 
      miry country road. They had to use all their strength to pull 
      the wagon, but they did not complain.
    <p>
    
    <p>
      The Wheels of the wagon were of a different sort. Though the 
      task they had to do was very light compared with that of the 
      Oxen, they creaked and groaned at every turn. The poor Oxen, 
      pulling with all their might to draw the wagon through the 
      deep mud, had their ears filled with the loud complaining of 
      the Wheels. And this, you may well know, made their work so 
      much the harder to endure.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Silence!" the Oxen cried at last, out of patience. "What have 
      you Wheels to complain about so loudly? We are drawing all the 
      weight, not you, and we are keeping still about it besides."
    </p>
